The following is the submitted assignment for Computer Science 2720: Practical Software Development.
The assignment revolves around the concept of test driven developement as well as
the concept of git and it's subsidaries. I felt it necessary to change the
Tokenizer class to one that was more suitable for develepment. I felt that the old
Tokenizer didn't open up the potential to my TDD molding until it was modified in
such a way that it was completely accessible to me for testing. As for testing,
the only thing I could not get to succeed was the final evaluation test. The numbers popped
out as identical twins, but the CPPUNIT comparision failed every single time. Thus, I have
left it as a sentiment to my head banging as I have yet to conclude what this craziness
that is bestowed upon this program be.
